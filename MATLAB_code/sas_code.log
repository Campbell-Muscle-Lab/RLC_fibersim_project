NOTE: With DDFM=SATTERTHWAITE or DDFM=KENWARDROGER, unadjusted p-values in tests are based on the 
      degrees of freedom specific to that comparison. P-values that are adjusted for multiplicity, 
      however, are by default based on the denominator degrees of freedom for the Type III test of 
      the fixed effect. If you specify the ADJDFE=ROW option in the LSMEANS or LSMESTIMATE statement, 
      the adjusted p-values take into account the row-wise degrees of freedom.


NOTE: Convergence criterion (ABSGCONV=0.00001) satisfied.
NOTE: Estimated G matrix is not positive definite.
